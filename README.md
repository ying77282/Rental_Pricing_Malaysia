# Rental_Pricing_Malaysia  


Objective:
This dataset contains rental pricing information for properties in the Kuala Lumpur and Selangor regions of Malaysia. The data was scraped from mudah.my, a popular local property platform.
The objective of this project is to leverage this dataset to build a pricing prediction model and identify factors influencing rental rates, such as location, property size, amenities, and market trends.

# 1) Data Collection Methodology:
   
Due to the lack of direct access to real-world property data, Kaggle was used as the primary platform to the source of relevant datasets.

The extensive research was done to collect data :


 a. Property Information (Internal Data)

- Property Location
     - Determines demand based on neighborhood factors. Identifying high-demand areas can help adjust pricing accordingly.
 
- Property Size (sq. ft.)
     - Compare with competitor properties to stay competitive.
 
- Amenities 
     - Visit the area to evaluate the convenience of nearby amenities (shopping centers, grocery stores, schools, hospitals, parks, restaurants, and public transport).
     - Identify upcoming infrastructure projects that could increase property demand.

- Furnishing Condition/ Number of Bedrooms/Bathrooms


 b. Competitor Information (External Data)
       
- Rental Prices
     - Gather data from listing platforms like mudah.my, PropertyGuru, and iProperty to adjust your pricing to match market trends.
     
- Amenities Offered
     - Identify amenities provided by competitors that add value to their properties.
 
- Unique Selling Points 
     - Understand what makes competitor properties more appealing (e.g., pet-friendly policies, flexible lease terms).
       
       
c. Tenant Demographics & Preferences (Survey Data)

- Age Group/ Group of tenants
     - Use tenant surveys or online census reports to target different demographics. Adjust marketing strategies based on tenant age groups (e.g., students, working professionals, families).
       
- Income Level
     - Analyze tenant income levels to understand their budget range and tailor property offerings accordingly.
       

d. Marketing Performance (Digital Data)

- Visiting Different Platforms
     - Track views, leads, and conversions from property platforms like mudah.my, Facebook Marketplace, PropertyGuru, and social media.
     - Create a simple performance report to compare platforms.
     - Make platform-specific adjustments to improve performance by tracking views and leads.
 
 
 e. Market Trends (Industry Data)

- Real Estate Development
     - Tracks new construction in the area. Stay aware of potential competition.

- Rental Market Trends
     - Monitor rental price fluctuations and demand trends through platforms like PropertyGuru Insights, iProperty Reports, and government housing reports. Adjust your pricing during high and low seasons 
       accordingly.
